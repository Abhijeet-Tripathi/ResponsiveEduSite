        Education originated as the transmission.Types of education are commonly divided into formal, non-formal, and informal education. 
        Formal education takes place in education and training institutions, is usually structured 
        by curricular aims and objectives, and learning is typically guided by a teacher.<br>
        Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting
        knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development
        of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty.<br>
        
        Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some
        theorists require that education results in an improvement of the student while others
        prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In a slightly different sense, education
        may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process: the mental states
        and dispositions possessed by educated people.
